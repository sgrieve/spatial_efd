    shapefile.ShapeRecord instances.

    This list can be iterated over, passing the individual shape instances
    to ProcessGeometry() one by one. There is no input handling if a non-polygon
    shapefile is passed in, that will result in undefined behavior.

    Args:
        filename (string): A filename with optional full path pointing to an
            ESRI shapefile to be loaded by the pyshp module. The file extension
            is optional.

    Returns:
        list: A list of shapefile._ShapeRecord objects representing each polygon
        geometry in the shapefile.

    where n is the index of the shape within a multipart geometry. This results
    in the contour, coordinate list and centroid data computed for the input
    polygon being normalized and returned to the user.

            and attributes of a single polygon from a multipart shapefile.

    Returns:
